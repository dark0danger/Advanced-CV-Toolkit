## 🚀 Features

This system integrates **8+ distinct Computer Vision functions** into a single dashboard:

*   **Face Detection:** Real-time face localization using Haar Cascades.
*   **Motion Analysis:** Background subtraction to detect and track moving objects.
*   **Eye Tracking:** Feature extraction to identify eyes within the frame.
*   **Edge Detection:** Canny algorithm implementation for structural analysis.
*   **Color Tracking:** HSV color space segmentation (tracks blue objects).
*   **Image Filters:** Gaussian Blur, Sepia, and Color Inversion.
*   **Media Tools:** Built-in video recording and screenshot capabilities.
*   **Interactive GUI:** Tabbed interface with a control panel built using Tkinter.
